# Delta Broadcast

## Status: Object delta placeholder types added (Stage 2 Task 6)

Player delta skeleton is complete. Object delta placeholder types are defined but not yet wired
into interest management or transport send. Voice group delta and transport send are deferred.

## Components

| Component | Package | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| DeltaBuilder | `internal/game/delta` | Computes per-client PlayerDelta from interest set and snapshot |
| ClientSnapshot | `internal/game/delta` | Per-session last-sent state (PlayerID → version) |
| SnapshotCache | `internal/game/delta` | Room-owned map of SessionID → ClientSnapshot |
| Room broadcast | `internal/game/room` | Calls DeltaBuilder at broadcast rate; clears dirty state |

## Per-Client Snapshot Cache

Each session has a `ClientSnapshot` in the room's `SnapshotCache`:

```go
type ClientSnapshot struct {
    VisiblePlayers map[player.PlayerID]uint32 // playerID → last-sent version
}
```

The snapshot is created on `CmdJoin` and removed on `CmdLeave` or `CmdDisconnect`.

Only the room loop reads and writes `ClientSnapshot` and `SnapshotCache`. Not goroutine-safe by design.

## Delta Semantics

For each broadcast tick, `DeltaBuilder.BuildPlayerDelta` compares the current interest set against the viewer's snapshot:

| Case | Delta type | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Player in visible set, not in snapshot | Enter | Add full transform; add to snapshot |
| Player in visible set, version changed | Update | Send new transform; update snapshot version |
| Player in visible set, version same | — | No entry (no change) |
| Player in snapshot, not in visible set | Leave | Emit leave; remove from snapshot |

The snapshot is updated in place as part of the same `BuildPlayerDelta` call.

## PlayerDelta

```go
type PlayerDelta struct {
    Tick    uint32
    Enters  []PlayerEnterDelta  // players newly visible
    Updates []PlayerUpdateDelta // visible players with changed transforms
    Leaves  []PlayerLeaveDelta  // players that left the interest range
}
```

`PlayerDelta.IsEmpty()` returns true when all three slices are empty. The room skips no-op batches.

## DeltaBatch

```go
type DeltaBatch struct {
    Tick        uint32
    PlayerDelta *PlayerDelta
    ObjectDelta *ObjectDelta // nil until object transport wiring (Milestone 4)
    // Future: VoiceGroupDelta
}
```

`DeltaBatch.IsEmpty()` returns true if all contained deltas are nil or empty.

## Dirty Tracking

The room marks a player as dirty (in `r.dirtyPlayers`) when `CmdPlayerInput` or `CmdUpdatePlayerTransform` updates their transform. The dirty set is cleared after each broadcast tick.

Dirty tracking exists as a foundation for future optimization (e.g., skip delta computation when no players in an interest range are dirty). The delta builder itself already handles no-change suppression via version comparison.

## Broadcast Rate

Broadcast runs at `RoomConfig.BroadcastRateHz` (default 10 Hz), which is a sub-rate of `TickRateHz` (default 20 Hz). For TickRate=20 / BroadcastRate=10, broadcast fires every 2nd tick.

```
Room tick (20 Hz):
  drain command queue
  [every 2nd tick] broadcast(tick):
    sessionMu.Lock
    buildDeltaBatches — interest query + delta computation per session
    clearDirtyPlayers
    sessionMu.Unlock
    [batches discarded — transport send is a future milestone]
```

## Transport Separation

- `DeltaBuilder` has no transport-specific fields or logic.
- `DeltaBatch` has no KCP/WebSocket metadata.
- The delta builder outputs domain data only; encoding and sending are deferred.
- Transport packages must not import `internal/game`.
- Native and WebGL clients receive semantically identical deltas.

## Interest Integration

`buildDeltaBatches` uses `InterestManager.QueryVisiblePlayers` (from `internal/game/interest`) to determine each viewer's visible player set. The spatial hash provides the proximity query. Both calls happen under `sessionMu.Lock` inside the room loop.

## Hard Rules

- No full-room full-state broadcast during normal operation.
- No transport-specific fields in delta types.
- No object or voice delta yet (deferred to later milestones).
- No Redis/KEDA dependency.

## Object Delta (Placeholder — Milestone 4)

Types are defined in `internal/game/delta/types.go`:

```go
type ObjectEnterDelta   // object newly visible
type ObjectUpdateDelta  // transform or lock changed; nil pointer fields = no change
type ObjectLeaveDelta   // object left interest range
type ObjectLockDelta    // lock granted / released / expired (may fire outside normal broadcast)
type ObjectDelta        // aggregates all of the above for one tick
```

Not yet wired to interest management, snapshot cache, or transport send.

## Not Yet Implemented

- MessagePack encoding of delta packets (deferred)
- Transport send (KCP or WSS) of encoded packets (deferred)
- Object interest management integration (spatial hash for objects)
- Object snapshot cache (per-session last-seen object version)
- `VoiceGroupDelta` (Milestone 5)
- LOD/blue-avatar thresholds in interest set (deferred)
- Full snapshot fallback on join/reconnect (deferred — FullSnapshot is a separate message type)
- Per-client bandwidth accounting (deferred)

## Tests

- DeltaBuilder: initial snapshot emits all enters, enter on new player, update on version change, leave on exit from interest, no-op when unchanged, far player excluded, missing state skipped, multiple leaves, version tracking, transport-agnostic types
- SnapshotCache: GetOrCreate creates once, returns same pointer, Remove cleans up, Len tracks count
- Room integration: snapshot created on join, removed on leave/disconnect, dirty count updated on transform, multi-session tracking, broadcast runs without panic
